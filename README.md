# nostrumfork
A fork of nostrum 0.6, which at least starts up and works with some bundles (nosgi)

The original nostrum has started as "nosgi" once upon a time, but later they had to
rename it because of copyright issues with the OSGi alliance. This is basically a
dynamic component / module system serving similar things like OSGi is doing for
Java - and running as a native c++ framework.

This works by various clever hacks when loading dynamic libraries.

You can find the original nostrum here:

(I don't see the experimental 0.6 version here anymore though which I used to fix up here)
